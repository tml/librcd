/*
 * Notes about the design: Most of the things done here is process global,
 * for example the signal actions and masks are not designed to be changed
 * while the program is running. This is because it's impossible to write
 * code that is safe and correctly changes the signal configuration while the
 * program is running. These weaknesses where know when the code was written
 * and stems from general broken-ness in the design (or rather lack of design)
 * in unix when it comes to anything asynchronous and message passing.
 *
 * While there is an interface that allows programs to sets their own signal
 * handlers, doing so is incredibly unsafe and should be avoided. For example,
 * if a signal is accepted in the memory allocator while it's holding a lock
 * the program could deadlock in the prolouge of the signal handler without
 * even entering the function.
